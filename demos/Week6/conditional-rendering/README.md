# Planning

## User stories

- As a user, I want to see a collection of ice creams displayed on the app.
- As a user, I want to click on the title of the ice cream to show extra information about the ice cream.

## Technical requirements

- Add image elements (<img>)
- An array to store the image information
  - Some kind of loop to render a large amount of data
- A button for the user to click to show image info
  - Event listener (onClick) and event handler (task)
- HTML elements to render the information
- We need a container (<div>) to render information
  - This container is conditionally rendered, depends on the user
  - This container is going to be a component that I can reuse
