//STEP 1: select the DOM elements that will contain my images
//select the thumbnail container
//select the main image container

//STEP 2: we are going to write a function to create the images in our thumbnail

function createThumbnails(thumbnailContainer) {
  //we need a loop to run through the array of images and create an instance of each of them --> forEach / for loop
  thumbnailContainer.forEach(function (thumbnail, index) {
    //a document method to create a DOM element to contain my image information(<img>)
    //assign a value to the img attributes (src, alt, width, height) --> img.src = "value"
    //optional: you can also give each image a classname
    //append the new images to the DOM container
    //add an event listener to each image, so when the user clicks, the big image shows on the screen
    //function eventHandler(){
    //when the user clicks the image,we are going to call the function that creates the big image
    createLargeImage(thumbnail[index]);
    // }
    //thumbnail.addEventListener("click", eventHandler)
  });
}

// STEP 3: we need to write a function to create the big image
function createLargeImage(largeImage) {
  //!you will find a problem here: your images will keep adding one after the other
  //innerHTML = ""
  //create an img element
  //(optional) you could give this large image a classname
  //set the src value
  //set the alt value
  //append the large img to the DOM
}

//In case you find reference code elsewhere
//This code I found on stackoverflow and it works for my app. Can you give me help understanding why?
