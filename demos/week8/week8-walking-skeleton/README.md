Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g YouTube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?
Submission Instructions
Please submit the deployed URL, your GitHub repository link and a screenshot of your Database Schema (and Query Editor, if it was used).

How to send your database schema:
In Supabase, select the project you have connected to this application.
In the menu, go to ‘Database’.
Then, go to ‘Schema Visualiser’.
Take a screenshot of the tables you’ve used and save it in your files.
On Moodle, in your submission, click the image icon and follow the instructions.

## Planning

- Start with your database!
  - Draw your tables and your schema. How can you connect them? (min. 2 tables)
- Wireframe!
- Divide your tasks into 15-20 min chunks
- If a task is too abstract or takes longer than 20 mins, can you divide it into smaller tasks?
- If your scope is getting out of hand, check the requirements! The requirements are your MVP.
  - Start building the app from the most basic version of it. What are the main building blocks?
- **Main requirements:**
  - Routes (static, dynamic)
  - Displaying the data from the db
  - Sending data to the db
