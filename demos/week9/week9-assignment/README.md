# Planning

- Concept and problem domain
- Wireframe
- Database schema
  - You need at least 2 tables (users and posts, for example)
  - One to many --> one user, many posts
  - Your foreign key should always be in the many table
    - Your foreign key in the many table should reference the clerk_id column in the one table

# Set up your app folder

# Set up Clerk

# Complete the pages with content for the user

    - Remember to add a component from Radix or another library!

# Deploy to Vercel
